                The Menagerie is a puzzle hunt inspired by the animal residents and other attractions of George Fabyan&apos;s sprawling estate Riverbank, referenced in David Kwong&apos;s Magic and puzzle show The Enigmatist and in the Enigmas deck that led you here. The specific menagerie and other attractions mentioned in this puzzle hunt are fictional, and no knowledge of the Fabyan Villa at Riverbank, or of the Enigmatist, is required while solving.

                A full slate of hints for each puzzle is available in the <a href="/hints" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-700 underline">Hints section</a> â€“ they can be revealed one at a time, with the intention that solvers will never need to see more information than they need at the moment, and hints should be taken liberally; in many cases they will provide instructions that might have been included as part of the main instructions for the puzzle but were relegated to hint status to provide an extra challenge for solvers who want to attack the puzzles in their most challenging form.

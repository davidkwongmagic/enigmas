Try breaking the lines up into likely words (even if you don't know why yet), and then try to figure out the rule that makes regular words into those close-but-not-quite words. If there is a particular letter, say X, that appears every so often but looks like it does not belong, consider that a rule might be \"Add an X [before/after/as the second letter of] each word,\" or maybe \"change each second letter [or each M] to X.\" Each line is a mini-puzzle in itself."

BEEKEEPI(NG) FACILI(TY)\nSo, the last letter is removed, and the new last letter is moved one forward in the alphabet. That second group was not one word, but two, giving:\nTECHNICAL TERM FOR BEEKEEPING FACILITY, which is APIARY\nThen apply the rule to APIARY, changing it to APIAS, which is (for now) the answer to the first item."
